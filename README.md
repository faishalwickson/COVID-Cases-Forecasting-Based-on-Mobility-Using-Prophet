# COVID-Cases-Forecasting-Based-on-Mobility-Using-Prophet
## Abstract
COVID-19 is a disease infecting human through human rapidly. Previous
research proved that nowadays community mobility affects the level of infection of
COVID-19. Thus, the government should implement a mobility restriction policy to
decrease the transmission, especially in a densely populated region like Java and
a highly visited region like Bali. This research aims to forecast daily new cases of
COVID-19 in the region of Java and Bali based on community mobility data as
regressor. This research implements the FBProphet model with tuned parameters
for each province within Mean of Absolute Percentage Error value in a range of
8,5% to 17,1%. In this research, the forecasting output is uploaded to an interactive
visualization dashboard for public access ease.

About notebooks:
1. covid.mobility.ipynb used to do predictive analysis using FBProphet. Including all research process from data exploration to Prophet component analysis.
2. covid.mobility.result.ipynb used to upload the output of FBProphet forecasting model into GSheets. Afterwards, the uploaded data would be visualized using Google Data Studio. The dashboard could be seen in https://datastudio.google.com/u/0/reporting/17d59169-7318-43ee-9516-6053115f78f4/page/hJOuC
